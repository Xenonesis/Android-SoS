Smart SOS & Safety Companion (Mobile App + Wearable Integration)

Concept
A simple mobile app (with optional wearable button integration) that lets users quickly send an SOS alert with location + situation type to trusted contacts or volunteers.

Core Features (MVP, easy to build)

One-Tap SOS Button – Sends live location + a short pre-set message (e.g., "Help! I’m in danger").

Safety Route Tracking – User shares live trip with friends/family; if the user deviates or stops unexpectedly, an alert is triggered.

Panic Gesture Trigger – Shake phone 3 times (or press button on wearable) to activate SOS without opening app.

Community Alert Network – Local volunteers (opt-in) get notified if someone nearby needs help.

Privacy-First Design – Location is only shared during an active SOS, not always.

Tech Stack (lightweight & easy)

Frontend: Flutter / React Native (cross-platform mobile app).

Backend: Firebase (authentication, real-time database, notifications).

Maps/Location: Google Maps API or Mapbox.

Wearable (optional add-on): A cheap Bluetooth button (IoT) that pairs with app to trigger SOS.

Why This Works

Simple to prototype in weeks.

Addresses women’s safety, child tracking, elderly emergencies.

Functional, scalable, and demo-friendly.
